\section{Introduction}

Nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF) is a dimensionality reduction technique that can be applied in a variety of domains. Like principal component analysis (PCA), NMF seeks to describe a large matrix of data using a small set of information dense components. Unlike PCA, which imposes orthogonality constraints on components, NMF requires nonnegativity after factorization. This procedure allows for only additive combinations of positive components to estimate the input matrix. The endpoint is a parts-based representation of the starting data where each component is more easily interpreted than PCA. A classical example of NMF is the factorization of a large database of human face images. Factorization using PCA will yield a series of ?eigenfaces? which can be added or subtracted, but individual components are not easy to interpret on their own. The NMF "parts-based" representation however, yields components like noses, eyes, ears, and mouths which can be added linearly to construct a face. 


A number of algorithms have been proposed in order to construct the NMF factorization with positivity constraints. Iterative algorithms, for example, build the WH factorization while converging on a local maximum of a specified object function. This project will examine two of such objective functions 1) the conventional least squares difference between the input and the factorization and 2) an objective function based on the Kullback-Leibler divergence2. The flop counts of algorithmic update rules for both approaches will both be assessed analytically and the different conditions for monotonic convergence will be examined. Both algorithms will be implemented in python using the ?numpy? and ?scipy? packages. The two approaches will be compared as follows: 1) In numeric simulations of input matrices with known contributions of signal and noise 2) using real-world gene expression data of cancer cells that have been exposed to different drugs grouped into known pharmacological classes. In simulations, the two algorithms will be compared by their accuracy after a fixed number of iterations. The approaches will also be compared in their ability to classify the gene expression profiles into known pharmacological groups.

\section{Problem Definition and Multiplicative Update Rules}

Text leading to definition... \\

\textbf{definition} For a nonnegative matrix $\bf{A} \in \mathbb{R}^{m x n} $, select a low-rank approximation of size k such that there are two nonnegative matrices \textbf{W} $ \in \mathbb{R}^{m x k}$ and \textbf{H} $ \in \mathbb{R}^{k x n}$ which minimizes a function such as 
$$ f( \textbf{W,H}) = \frac{1}{2} || \textbf{A - WH} || ^{2}_{F}$$


Other commonly used objective functions include Euclidian distance and Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence. KL can be extended to a more general information-based framework using Renyi's divergence. (Devarajan, 2005). Here, a single parameter $\alpha$ is used to represent a continuum of distance measures and KL airises as a special case as $\alpha \to 1$. 

$$ KL(V || WH) = \sum_{ij}{[V_{ij} \log{ \frac{V_{ij}}{(WH)_{ij}} - V_{ij} + (WH)_{ij}} ]} $$



\section{Update Rules}



\section{Special fonts}

SIAM supports the use of the AMS-\TeX\ fonts (version 2.0
and later). The package \verb|amsfonts| can be included with
the command\linebreak \verb|\usepackage{amsfonts}|. This package
is part of the AMS-\LaTeX distribution, available
from the AMS or from the Comprehensive TeX Archive
Network (anonymous ftp to ftp.shsu.edu). The blackboard bold font in this
font package can be used for designating number sets. 
This is preferable to other methods of combining letters
(such as I and R for the real numbers) to produce pseudo-bold
letters but this is tolerable as well. Typographically speaking,
number sets may simply be designated using regular bold letters; 
the blackboard bold typeface was designed to fulfil a desire
to simulate the limitations of a chalk board in printed type.


\subsection{Punctuation}
All standard punctuation and all numerals should be set in roman type
(upright) even within italic text. The only exceptions are periods and 
commas. They may be set to match the surrounding text.

References to sections should use the symbol \S, generated by
\verb|\S|. (If the reference begins a sentence, the term ``Section''
should be spelled out in full.) Authors should not redefine
\verb|\S|, say, to be a calligraphic S, because \verb|\S|
must be reserved for use as the section symbol.  

Authors sometimes confuse the use of various types of dashes.
Hyphens (\verb|-|, -) are used for some compound words (many
such words should have no hyphen but must be run together, 
like ``nonzero,'' or split apart, like ``well defined''). 
Minus signs (\verb|$-$|, $-$)
should be used in math to represent subtraction or negative numbers.
En dashes (\verb|--|, --) are used for ranges (like 3--5, 
June--August), or for joined names (like Runge--Kutta). Em dashes
(\verb|---|, ---) are used to set off a clause---such as this 
one---from the rest of the sentence. 


\subsection{Text formatting}

SIAM style preferences do not make regular use of the \verb|{enumerate}|
and \verb|{itemize}| environments. Instead,
{\tt siamltex.cls} includes definitions of two alternate list
environments, \verb|{remunerate}| and \verb|{romannum}|.
Unlike the standard itemized lists, these environments do
not indent the secondary lines of text. The labels, whether
defaults or the optional user-defined, are always aligned
flush right.

The \verb|{remunerate}| environment consecutively numbers
each item with an arabic numeral followed by a period. This
number is always upright, even in slanted
environments. (For those wondering at the unusual
naming of this environment, it comes from Seroul and Levy's
\cite{SerLev} definition of a similar macro for plain \TeX: 
%{\tt \char"5C meti} 
\verb|\meti| which is
% {\tt \char"5C item}
\protect\verb|\item|  spelled backwards. Thus
%{\tt \{remunerate\}}, 
\verb|{remunerate}|
a portion of 
%{\tt \{enumerate\}}
\verb|{enumerate}|
spelled backwards.)

The \verb|{romannum}| environment consecutively numbers
each item with a lower-case roman numeral enclosed in
parentheses. This number will always be upright within
slanted environments (as in theorems).


\section{Theorems and Lemmas}
Theorems, lemmas, corollaries, definitions, and propositions are covered
in the SIAM macros by the theorem-environments
\verb|{theorem}|, \verb|{lemma}|, \verb|{corollary}|,
\verb|{definition}| and \verb|{proposition}|. These are all
numbered in the same sequence and produce labels in small 
caps with an italic body. Other environments may be specified by the
\verb|\newtheorem| command. SIAM's style is for Remarks and Examples
to appear with italic labels and an upright roman body.

\begin{verbatim}

\begin{theorem}
Sample theorem included for illustration.  
Numbers and parentheses, like equation $(3.2)$, should be set 
in roman type.  Note that words (as opposed to ``log-like''
functions) in displayed equations, such as
$$ x^2 = Y^2 \sin z^2 \mbox{ for all } x $$
will appear in italic type in a theorem, though normally
they should appear in roman.\end{theorem}

\end{verbatim}

This sample produces Theorem 4.1 below.

\begin{theorem}
Sample theorem included for illustration.  
Numbers and parentheses, like equation $(3.2)$, should be set 
in roman type.  Note that words (as opposed to ``log-like''
functions) in displayed equations, such as
$$ x^2 = Y^2 \sin z^2 \mbox{ for all } x $$
will appear in italic type in a theorem, though normally
they should appear in roman.
\end{theorem}


Proofs are handled with the \verb|\begin{proof}|
\verb|\end{proof}| environment. A ``QED'' box \endproof\ is created
automatically by \verb|\end{proof}|, but this should be
preceded with a \verb|\qquad|.

Named proofs, if used, must be done independently by the
authors. SIAM style specifies that proofs which end with
displayed equations should have the QED box two ems (\verb|\qquad|)
from the end of the equation on line with it horizontally.
Below is an example of how this can be done:

\begin{verbatim}

{\em Proof}. Proof of the previous theorem 
                .
                .
                .
thus,
$$
a^2 + b^2 = c^2 \qquad\endproof
$$

\end{verbatim}


\section{Figures and tables}
Figures and tables sometimes require special consideration.
Tables in SIAM style are need to be set in eight point size
by using the \verb|\footnotesize| command inside the 
\verb|\begin{table}| environment. Also, they should be designed 
so that they do not extend beyond the text margins. 

SIAM style requires that no figures or tables  appear in the
references section of the paper. \LaTeX\ is notorious for
making figure placement difficult, so it is important to
pay particular attention to figure placement near the
references in the text. All figures and tables should
be referred to in the text.

SIAM supports the use of {\tt epsfig} for including {\sc PostScript}
figures. All {\sc Post\-Script} figures should be sent in separate
files. See the {\tt epsfig} documentation (available via
anonymous ftp from CTAN: ftp.shsu.edu) for more details on the use
of this style option. It is a good idea to submit high-quality
hardcopy of all {\sc Post\-Script} figures just in case there 
is difficulty in the reproduction of the figure. Figures produced 
by other non-\TeX\ methods should be included as high-quality 
hardcopy when  the manuscript is submitted.

{\sc PostScript} figures that are sent should be generated with
sufficient line thickness. Some past figures authors have sent
had their line widths become very faint when SIAM set the papers
using a high-quality 1200dpi printer.

Hardcopy for non-{\sc PostScript} figures should be included in
the submission of the hardcopy of the manuscript. Space
should be left in the \verb|{figure}| command for the
hardcopy to be inserted in production.

\section{Bibliography and Bib\TeX}

If using {\sc Bib}\TeX, authors need not submit the {\tt .bib} file for
their papers. Merely submit the completed {\tt .bbl} file, having used
{\tt siam.bst} as their bibliographic style file. {\tt siam.bst}
only works with Bib\TeX\ version 99i and later. The use of
Bib\TeX\ and the preparation of a {\tt .bib} file is
described in greater detail in \cite{Lamport}.

If not using Bib\TeX, SIAM bibliographic references follow
the format of the following examples:

\begin{verbatim}

\bibitem{Ri} {\sc W. Riter},
{\em Title of a paper appearing in a book}, in The Book 
Title, E.~D. One, E.~D. Two, and A.~N. Othereditor, eds., 
Publisher, Location, 1992, pp.~000--000.

\bibitem{AuTh1} {\sc A.~U. Thorone}, {\em Title of paper
with lower case letters}, SIAM J. Abbrev. Correctly, 2
(1992), pp.~000--000.

\bibitem{A1A2} {\sc A.~U. Thorone and A.~U. Thortwo}, {\em
Title of paper appearing in book}, in Book Title: With All
Initial Caps, Publisher, Location, 1992.

\bibitem{A1A22} \sameauthor, % generates the 3 em rule
{\em Title of Book{\rm :} Note Initial Caps and {\rm ROMAN
TYPE} for Punctuation and Acronyms}, Publisher,
Location, pp.~000--000, 1992.

\bibitem{AuTh3} {\sc A.~U. Thorthree}, {\em Title of paper
that's not published yet}, SIAM. J. Abbrev. Correctly, to appear.

\end{verbatim}

Other types of references fall into the same general
pattern. See the sample file or any SIAM journal for other
examples. Authors must correctly format their bibliography to
be considered as having used the macros correctly. An incorrectly 
formatted bibliography is not only time-consuming for SIAM to
process but it is possible that errors may be introduced into 
it by keyboarders/copy editors.

As an alternative to the above style of reference, an alphanumeric
code may be used in place of the number (e.g., [AUTh90]). The same
commands are used, but \verb|\bibitem| takes an optional argument
containing the desired alphanumeric code. 

Another alternative is no number, simply the authors' names and
the year of publication following in parentheses. The rest of the
format is identical. The macros do not support this alternative
directly, but modifications to the macro definition are possible
if this reference style is preferred.


\section{Conclusion} Many other style suggestions and tips
could be given to help authors but are beyond the scope of this
document. Simple mistakes can be avoided by increasing your familiarity
with how \LaTeX\ functions. The books referred to throughout this document
are also useful to the author who wants clear, beautiful typography
with minimal mistakes. 

\Appendix
\section{The use of appendices}
The \verb|\appendix| command may be used before the final sections
of a paper to designate them as appendices. Once \verb|\appendix|
is called, all subsequent sections will appear as 

\appendix
\section{Title of appendix} Each one will be sequentially lettered
instead of numbered. Theorem-like environments, subsections,
and equations will also have the section number changed to a letter.

If there is only {\em one} appendix, however, the \verb|\Appendix|
(with a capital letter) should be used instead. This produces only 
the word {\bf Appendix} in the section title, and does not add a letter.
Equation numbers, theorem numbers and subsections of the appendix
will have the letter ``A''  designating the section number.

If you don't want to title your appendix, and just call it
{\bf Appendix A.} for example, use \verb|\appendix\section*{}| 
and don't include anything in the title field. This works
opposite to the way \verb|\section*| usually works, by including the
section number, but not using a title.

 
Appendices should appear before the bibliography section, not after,
and any acknowledgments should be placed after the appendices and before
the bibliography.
